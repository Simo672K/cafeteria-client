# Cafeteria mobile app
This is an MVP cafeteria mobile app built on top of react native with expo and react navigation, axios, redux with redux-toolkit on the client side. Firebase as a backend.

### Running development server 
To run the project on your machine, first you need to clone this repo into your local machine using the following commande:
```
git clone "https://github.com/Simo672K/cafeteria-client.git"
```

On the same directory where you cloned the project, type the following commande to change path to project directory:
```
cd cafeteria-client
``` 

Now you need to install dependencies, on your terminal type:
```
npm install
```

> **_Note_** You need node installed on your machine.

After installing dependencies, run a local server using the command:
```
npm start
```

Install the expo go app on your phone or use an emulator, scan the QrCode generated by the dev server, bingo!! that's it
